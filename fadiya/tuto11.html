<p lang="en-US" align="justify"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>1.Patents</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Patents
grant inventors exclusive rights to their inventions, such as new
products, processes, or methods. These rights enable inventors to
prevent others from making, using, selling, or importing their
patented inventions for a limited period, typically 20 years from the
filing date.</span></span></font></p>
<p align="justify">A patent is granted for a term of 20 (twenty)
years from the date of filling of the application. It is important to
note that patent for a new invention is registered only if the
invention is ‘novel’ and ‘original’ i.e. it has not been
introduced in the public domain in India or anywhere in the world; is
‘capable of industrial application’ which refers to the ability
of the invention to be used in an industry; and is an invention that
requires to employ a process of ‘inventive steps’, which is
defined as ‘a feature of an invention that involves technical
advance as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic
significance or both and that makes the invention not obvious to a
person skilled in the art’, under the Patents Act.</p>

<p align="justify"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b><span lang="en-US">2.Copyrights</span></b></font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">Copyrights
protect original works of authorship, such as literary, artistic,
musical, or dramatic creations. Authors, artists, and creators gain
exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, perform, and display their
copyrighted works for a limited period, generally the creator’s
lifetime plus 50 or 70 years.</span></font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">Copyright
protects the expression of an idea rather than the idea itself. Under
section 13 of the Copyright Act, a protection under copyright can be
obtained for ‘original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic
works; cinematograph films; and sound recording’. Interestingly, a
copyright protection can also be obtained for computer programmes. A
copyright is an ‘exclusive right’ that is granted to a person to
do or authorize to carry out certain activities with regards the
copyrighted work. For eg: in case of a literary, dramatic or musical
work, the owner (or any person authorized by the owner) is permitted
to perform the work; make translation(s) of such work; make
adaptations of the work, etc.</span></font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>3.Trademarks</b></font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Trademarks
are distinctive signs, symbols, or logos that distinguish the goods
or services of one business from those of others. Trademark
registration provides brand owners with exclusive rights to use their
marks in connection with specific goods or services, protecting their
brand identity and reputation.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
Trade Marks Act, under section 2(zb) defines a ‘trade mark’ as ‘a
mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of
distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of
others and may include shape of goods, their packaging and
combination of colours…’. In simpler words, a trademark provides
protection for symbols, colours, shapes, words, etc. representing and
relating to a good or a service.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>4.Trade
secrets</b></font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Trade
secrets are confidential and valuable business information that
provides a competitive advantage to a company. Unlike patents, trade
secrets do not require registration and remain protected as long as
they remain confidential.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A
trade secret is a formula, practice, process, design or compilation
of information used by a business to obtain an advantage over
competitors. Trade secrets are by definition not disclosed to the
world at large.</font></p>
